      <h2 class="text-primary mb-4">About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Plastic Pollution in the Ocean Awareness Website is an educational
        and awareness platform created to highlight one of the most critical
        environmental issues affecting our planet today — plastic pollution in
        marine environments. The website serves as a central source of
        information to help people understand how plastic waste enters the
        ocean, why it is dangerous, and what actions can be taken to reduce its
        impact. <br />pollution has become a global problem due to the
        widespread use of single-use plastics and improper waste management.
        Every year, millions of tonnes of plastic waste are carried into the
        ocean through rivers, drains, coastal activities, and marine industries.
        Once in the ocean, plastic does not decompose naturally; instead, it
        breaks down into smaller fragments known as microplastics, which remain
        in the environment for hundreds of years and pose serious threats to
        marine life and ecosystems.

      <p>
        <br />
        This website aims to educate and inform users by presenting real facts,
        statistics, images, and examples of how plastic pollution affects
        oceans, marine animals, and human health. Visitors can learn about the
        causes of ocean plastic pollution, such as littering, poor recycling
        systems, and excessive plastic production, as well as the harmful
        effects including animal entanglement, ingestion of plastic, habitat
        destruction, and contamination of the food chain.<br />
        In addition to raising awareness, the website focuses on solutions and
        positive action. It encourages responsible plastic use, waste reduction,
        recycling, and the adoption of eco-friendly alternatives. The platform
        also promotes participation in cleanup activities, community programs,
        and global campaigns aimed at protecting marine environments.

       <br> <strong>Mission</strong><br>The mission of the Plastic Pollution in the Ocean Awareness
        Website is to inspire individuals, communities, and organizations to
        take responsibility for their plastic consumption and actively
        contribute to protecting the ocean. By increasing awareness and sharing
        practical solutions, the website seeks to drive meaningful behavioral
        change. </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Vision</strong><br>The vision of this website is a future where oceans are
        clean, healthy, and free from plastic pollution — a world where marine
        ecosystems thrive and future generations can enjoy safe, sustainable,
        and beautiful oceans.
